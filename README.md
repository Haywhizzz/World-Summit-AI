# World-Summit-AI
This is an HTML &amp; CSS Capstone Project and it is a World Summit AI website with inspiration from the original website which the event is one in which the brightest brains in AI gather to talk about the global AI ecosystem of Enterprise, BigTech, Startups, Investors and Science.

I was given [this design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015) of [Cindy Shin](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015)'s to follow, mirroring its structure, typography and colors as I built my own conference website.

After some cursory research, I discovered that a World Ai Summit would be taking place later thois year, and I decided this would be the conference for which I would build my website.
